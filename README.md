# JS-CC-006 : Roman Numerals

- Purpose of the this coding challenge is to write a code that given numbers convert to Roman Numerals. The Romans wrote numbers using letters - I, V, X, L, C, D, M. (notice these letters have lots of straight lines and are hence easy to hack into stone tablets).

- Example:

```
1000=M 900=CM 90=XC

2008 is written as MMVIII:

2000=MM 8=VIII
```

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of the this coding challenge, students will be able to;

- Analyze a problem, identify and apply programming knowledge for appropriate solution.

- Demonstrate their knowledge of algorithmic design principles by using JavaScript and Python effectively.

## Problem Statement

- Write a function that takes normal number(` 8, 148, 457` ) and convert to Roman Numerals(` VIII, CXLVIII, CDLVII` )

- Please note that, there is no need to be able to convert numbers larger than about 3000. (The Romans themselves didn't tend to go any higher)
